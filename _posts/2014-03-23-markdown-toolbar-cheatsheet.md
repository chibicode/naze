I've created a markdown cheatsheet for non-technical people: [markdown.chibi.io](http://markdown.chibi.io/).

Non-technical people are used to MS Word, Google Docs, Evernote, Wordpress, etc., all of which have a toolbar like above. By showing a mapping from a toolbar icon to the corresponding markdown syntax, non-technical will be able to learn Markdown faster.

Here's what happens when you click a button:

Minor details: I've included buttons for <u>underlines</u> and <del>strikethroughs</del>. They're not supported by the base Markdown implementation, but non-technical people will be confused if those buttons don't exist.

I haven't added the `code/pre` syntax or GitHub Flavored Markdown stuff, because non-technical people won't need them. To learn about these, visit GitHub's [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/).

[markdown.chibi.io](http://markdown.chibi.io/) is built with Jekyll and the repo is at: [chibicode/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet](https://github.com/chibicode/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet). Enjoy!
