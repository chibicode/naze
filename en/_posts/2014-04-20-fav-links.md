    > Kickstarter has become somewhat of a pre-order platform, and people are used to ordering what they see, not what it might become after funding.

    > I don't mean to be overly critical towards crowd funding, but one of the big illusions "sold" by crowd funding platforms is that anyone can get their pet project funded. In reality a lot of the people (if not indeed most of them) you see doing well on Kickstarter are extremely well-connected on social media or otherwise well-known. Crowd funding is a way of leveraging that kind of clout. If you don't have that, it can be tough even getting your message in front of the right audience.

    > One does not simply walk into Kickstarter. Successful people put a lot of effort into looking like they are just casually letting the world know about their thing and, behold, great fame and money follows. But that's not what's actually happening behind the scenes. Crowd funding is not the big equalizer, it's just another way of leveraging marketing potential that already exists.

But it went live a year after their first product, an industry whitepaper they called [Evaluating 25 E-Commerce Search Engines](http://signalvnoise.com/archives2/free_ecommerce_search_report.php). It was 45 pages and sold for $79. (Two years later, they decided to give it away for free.)

    > I often get asked why I, as a full-time author, don’t sell my books on Amazon or the iBooks store. **The biggest reason is the lack of customer information.** I want to sell directly to my customers so that I can email them to ask how they like it, know who is buying it and where, and be able to build on that relationship to make my next book launch more successful than the last.

    > Through Gumroad I get all the information on my customers—I can teach them through other emails and promote future products to them. Without that, I don’t think I could have built a business to the same level that I’ve been able to.

    > Finally, I would love to teach, but, [ as Nielson wrote], “I’m truly angry that parents put so much stress, fear, and anticipation into their kids’ heads” to achieve a meaningless numeric grade that is inconsequential to their future needs, especially since their children’s teachers are being cowed into meeting expectations and standards that are not conducive to their children’s futures.

* **[College, the Great Unleveler - NYTimes.com - NYTimes.com](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/college-the-great-unleveler/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0)**

    > First, federal student aid has become less effective in promoting opportunity. In the 1970s, the maximum Pell grants for low-income students covered nearly 80 percent of costs at the average four-year public university, but by 2013-14 they covered just 31 percent. Presidents beginning with Bill Clinton introduced costly new tax policies to help with tuition, but these have failed to improve access for the less well off.

    > Second, state governments, burdened by the growing cost of Medicaid, K-12 education and prisons, let higher education funding dwindle. Spending per full-time public student fell by an average of 26 percent in real terms between 1990-91 and 2009-10. Besides raising tuition, public colleges have had to squeeze resources at the schools themselves. For poorer students, graduating becomes all the harder as class sizes grow, online courses proliferate and support services are cut.

    > Third, Congress, by loosening regulations, permitted for-profit colleges to thrive on the government’s dime. These schools, which enroll nearly a tenth of college students, use nearly a quarter of federal student aid dollars allocated through Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and they account for nearly half of all student loan defaults. A 1998 rule allows them to gain up to 90 percent of their revenues from Title IV alone — a figure that does not include their substantial use of military education money. Even during the 2008 financial downturn, the top publicly traded for-profits enjoyed growth. Their upper management and shareholders benefit at the expense of American taxpayers and students.

* **[George Packer: Is Amazon Bad for Books? : The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/17/140217fa_fact_packer)**

    > Bezos said that Amazon intended to sell books as a way of gathering data on affluent, educated shoppers. The books would be priced close to cost, in order to increase sales volume. After collecting data on millions of customers, Amazon could figure out how to sell everything else dirt cheap on the Internet. (Amazon says that its original business plan “contemplated only books.”)

    I agree with pretty much everything Sam says about this.

    > People seem to be more sensitive to relative economic status than absolute. So even if people are much better off being poor today than king 500 years ago, most people compare themselves to the richest people today, and not the richest people from the past.

    > And importantly, it really is unfair.  Trying to live on minimum wage in the United States is atrocious. That budget, incidentally, assumes that the worker is working two jobs.  Even though they’re outputting less value, that person is certainly working harder than I am.  We should do more to help people like this.

    > ... Even if only a small percentage of people were productive, in a world where some people create 10,000x more value than others, that’d be ok.  The main point I’m trying to make is that we’re likely going to have to do something new and uncomfortable, and we should be open to any new ideas.

    > But this still doesn’t address the fundamental issue—I believe most people want to be productive.  And I think figuring out a much better way to teach a lot more people about technology is likely the best way to make that happen.

    > Also, this is the surest way to degrade your professionalism. Professionals hold fast to their prices; amateurs don’t. If your goal is to build the best damn company in the world (and if you’re following my work, this should be your focus!) then never, ever lower your standards.

    > **Brad Bird:** When I first started at Disney, the old master animators were slowly leaving, and there was an animator in his 40s starting to direct films there; management was sort of grooming him to take over animation at the studio. Anyway, he had taken over a film and had a bunch of us meet in his office. The first thing that came out of his mouth was, “I’m here to teach you. I’m satisfied with what I do.” In that opening statement, he lost me because I had already worked with the old Disney masters—and they were never satisfied.

    > Postgres already has a JSON data type, but hstore is significantly (i.e. WAY) faster, essentially because JSON is stored as a text string, while hstore is a binary string (so it doesn’t have to be parsed, and can be indexed). hstore’s speed and support for querying has already made it an attractive choice for a key-value store. The main reasons to use JSON over hstore (summarized well here) were previously that hstore lacked (1) nesting (2) types (3) validation of JSON formatting.

    > Some highlights of the coming changes which should address these limitations:

    > - Support for scalars and types (numeric, boolean, strings, NULL) support, along with new corresponding operators
    > - Support for nesting and arrays (the authors propose that output format, i.e. brackets v. curly braces, be configured with GUC variables)
    > - Essentially, full compatibility between hstore and JSON, so JSON documents can now take full advantage of hstore’s indexes (with GIN in particular, the authors ballparked a 120x speed improvement for JSON search performance)

    > He's been at this for a couple of weeks: if you watch his RailsConf keynote, you'll hear him say that he has very little theoretical computer science knowledge. Then he pooh-poohs the value of that same theoretical knowledge: knowledge which he just said that he doesn't have! It's normal human behavior to form opinions before understanding something. I certainly wouldn't want to deny anyone their human fallibility. However, to stand in front of thousands of eager followers that will believe anything you say, and to proclaim radical, outlandish positions, using made-up history as justification, on topics that you admit to not understanding... that just seems bad.

    > TDD is useful and test isolation is useful, but they both involve making trade-offs. Unfortunately, doing them 100% of the time seems to be the best way to learn what those trade-offs are, and that can temporarily lead beginners toward extremism. TDD and isolation both break down in some situations, and learning to detect those situations in advance takes a lot of time. This is true of advanced techniques in any discipline, programming or otherwise. That is the honest, non-exaggerated, no-lies-involved truth.

    > How does testing play into this? Jim noted several times in his talk that once he had separated a concern, he could test that concern more easily, and the test would run faster because it wasn't coupled to the Rails framework. DHH contends that by focusing on test speed Jim was damaging his design. But Jim would have done this separation no matter how fast the tests were running. Jim would have done it because it enhanced changeability, and made the business rules much clearer than they were before. Jim's separation improved, it did not damage, the design of the code.

I worry about the reckoning to come when Square sells to Apple for less than its investors had hoped, or when Medium shuts down or gets acquired (or pivots to provide something other than an attractive, New Yorker-themed CMS for writers, the poorest people in the first world). While Biz Stone will walk away from Jelly smiling about yet another “valuable failure” and Soleio and Matas will always have their bodies of work, ordinary designers will be asked to please gather their things and leave the conference room in which CTOs and VPs of Sales and CEOs who remember how useless all of Square’s attention to detail turned out to be will resume making decisions. Design has, after all, passed out of vogue before.

    > In order to avoid losing its place atop organizations, design must deliver results. Designers must also accept that if they don’t, they’re not actually designing well; in technology, at least, the subjective artistry of design is mirrored by the objective finality of use data. A “great” design which produces bad outcomes —low engagement, little utility, few downloads, indifference on the part of the target market— should be regarded as a failure.

    > I try and understand how other people navigate our messy, confusing world. What decisions do people make about their lives? What are the patterns in these decisions, and the interesting exceptions? What values drive these decisions, both the values people know about and the ones they don't? What is someone looking for out of a particular experience? What delights them, frustrates them, intrigues them? Constantly asking these questions helps build my intuition about how the particular product I'm building fits into peoples' lives.

    > I like to run SelfControl for a minimum of 2 hours at a time. I still find my Twitter app mysteriously appearing in front of me, having been launched by my treacherous hands during a moment of thought, but it just fails to connect and then I remember that I’m focusing right now. I really, really need the extra strictness. SelfControl allows me to actually work when I’m working from home.
