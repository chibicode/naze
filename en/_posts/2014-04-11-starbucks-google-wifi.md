Starbucks at [565 San Antonio Rd Mountain View, CA 94040](http://maps.google.com/maps?es_sm=91&q=565+San+Antonio+Rd+Mountain+View,+CA+94040&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x808fb09ea7dcd47f:0x11046dca03332d27,565+San+Antonio+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94040&gl=us&sa=X&ei=O1xIU9WyG-2yygG3wIH4DQ&ved=0CCcQ8gEwAA) has replaced AT&T wifi with Google Wifi. I'm sure there are other locations with Google Wifi, but this was the first one I've found.
