I feel that 80% of the best AngularJS practices are scattered across various articles on the web, whereas the remaining 20% are concentrated in books and other educational curriculums. So I decided to focus on the big wins (= long tail) and compiled a list of the best practices articles.

## Notes

* Each article is accompanied with the date I added the article to this list. It's not the article's published date.
* Videos are tagged as <i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i>.
* Thanks [copy-as-markdown](https://github.com/chitsaou/copy-as-markdown) for saving me tons of time.
* Thanks [strfti.me](http://strfti.me/) and [sublimetext-insertdate](https://github.com/FichteFoll/sublimetext-insertdate) for date insertion.
