    > Kickstarter has become somewhat of a pre-order platform, and people are used to ordering what they see, not what it might become after funding.

    > I don't mean to be overly critical towards crowd funding, but one of the big illusions "sold" by crowd funding platforms is that anyone can get their pet project funded. In reality a lot of the people (if not indeed most of them) you see doing well on Kickstarter are extremely well-connected on social media or otherwise well-known. Crowd funding is a way of leveraging that kind of clout. If you don't have that, it can be tough even getting your message in front of the right audience.

    > One does not simply walk into Kickstarter. Successful people put a lot of effort into looking like they are just casually letting the world know about their thing and, behold, great fame and money follows. But that's not what's actually happening behind the scenes. Crowd funding is not the big equalizer, it's just another way of leveraging marketing potential that already exists.

* **[Why You Should Do A Tiny Product First](http://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first)**

    > Their first product wasn’t what you’d think
You’d think: Basecamp. We all know Basecamp came first, right? Wellll… yes, it came first among their software. But it went live a year after their first product, an industry whitepaper they called [Evaluating 25 E-Commerce Search Engines](http://signalvnoise.com/archives2/free_ecommerce_search_report.php). It was 45 pages and sold for $79. (Two years later, they decided to give it away for free.)

    >That’s right: 37signals started with an ebook.
