> **YOLO-GEN SAT:** The College Board, which announced the redesign of SAT in March, has made yet another change to the reading section of SAT. “We replaced obscure vocab words with words students actually use in college,” the spokesperson said. “And the majority of those new words will be drawn from the most popular dictionary among college students--[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/).” In the updated exam, students will be asked to identify an antonym of “[yolomawmit](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yolomawmit&defid=7537789)” or describe what “[please advise](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Please%20Advise&defid=6946100)” means in a given context. By learning these terms, students can prevent themselves from becoming “[employmentally challenged](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=employmentally%20challenged&defid=4912046),” said the College Board.
