* <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> **[Technology and wealth inequality - Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/technology-and-wealth-inequality)**

    I agree with pretty much everything Sam says about this.

    > People seem to be more sensitive to relative economic status than absolute. So even if people are much better off being poor today than king 500 years ago, most people compare themselves to the richest people today, and not the richest people from the past.

    > And importantly, it really is unfair.  Trying to live on minimum wage in the United States is atrocious. That budget, incidentally, assumes that the worker is working two jobs.  Even though they’re outputting less value, that person is certainly working harder than I am.  We should do more to help people like this.

    > ... Even if only a small percentage of people were productive, in a world where some people create 10,000x more value than others, that’d be ok.  The main point I’m trying to make is that we’re likely going to have to do something new and uncomfortable, and we should be open to any new ideas.

    > But this still doesn’t address the fundamental issue—I believe most people want to be productive.  And I think figuring out a much better way to teach a lot more people about technology is likely the best way to make that happen.

* <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> **[The Web Is a Customer Service Medium (Ftrain.com)](http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html)**

    > The web is not, despite the desires of so many, a publishing medium. The web is a customer service medium. “Intense moderation” in a customer service medium is what “editing” was for publishing.

* <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> **[Three Things](http://blog.codinghorror.com/three-things/)**

    > You should be able to instantly answer this simple question, each day, every day, for the rest of your life. Without any tools other than the brain you were born with.

    > If you don't have this skill, develop it. Practice, starting today. Right now.

* **[Never Negotiate Your Freelance Rate](http://planscope.io/blog/never-negotiate-freelance-rate/)**

    > **Almost everyone who asks for a lower rate will pay what you originally quoted.**

    > Because I work — both directly and through osmosis — with literally thousands of freelancers, I can tell you it’s pretty rare to find a client who walks because they can’t score a last minute discount on a project.

    > Also, this is the surest way to degrade your professionalism. Professionals hold fast to their prices; amateurs don’t. If your goal is to build the best damn company in the world (and if you’re following my work, this should be your focus!) then never, ever lower your standards.

* **[Innovation lessons from Pixar: An interview with Oscar-winning director Brad Bird | McKinsey & Company](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/innovation/innovation_lessons_from_pixar_an_interview_with_oscar-winning_director_brad_bird)**

    > **The Quarterly:** What kinds of leaders inhibit innovation?

    > **Brad Bird:** When I first started at Disney, the old master animators were slowly leaving, and there was an animator in his 40s starting to direct films there; management was sort of grooming him to take over animation at the studio. Anyway, he had taken over a film and had a bunch of us meet in his office. The first thing that came out of his mouth was, “I’m here to teach you. I’m satisfied with what I do.” In that opening statement, he lost me because I had already worked with the old Disney masters—and they were never satisfied.

* **[TDD is dead. Long live testing. (DHH)](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html)**

    > I don't think that's healthy. Test-first units leads to an overly complex web of intermediary objects and indirection in order to avoid doing anything that's "slow". Like hitting the database. Or file IO. Or going through the browser to test the whole system. It's given birth to some truly horrendous monstrosities of architecture. A dense jungle of service objects, command patterns, and worse.

* **[Employee Equity - Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity)**

    > There are four major problems:
    >
    > 1) Employees usually don’t get enough stock.
    >
    > 2) If an employee leaves the company, he or she often can’t afford to exercise and pay taxes on their options.
    >
    > 3) Employee options sometimes get unfavorable tax treatment.
    >
    > 4) Employees usually don’t have enough information about the stock or options.
