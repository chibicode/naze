Hi, I'm Shu Uesugi. I am a hacker at [EdSurge](http://edsurge.com/), an education technology startup in Silicon Valley. I have a weird birthmark on my face.

Although I call myself a hacker, I *don't* love building things. However, I *do* love exploiting arbitrage opportunities in everyday life. I believe that these two personality traits—the passion for *building* and the passion for *hacking*—can be and should be decoupled. On this site, I'll share lessons learned from hacking real-world systems while *minimizing* the amount of code written.

Although I work at one of the most competitive places on earth, I'm inherently lazy. Before EdSurge, I spent several months in Japan doing absolutely nothing. I *don't* believe in "work hard, party hard" mentality; I'd rather work easy and sleep lots.

Before that, I worked at [Quora](http://quora.com/) as a designer and [Palantir](http://palantir.com/) as an engineer. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon's B.S. Computer Science and Masters HCI program in 2010.

I also love to teach. In 2013, I taught my girlfriend to code, and she went from zero to becoming a product designer in 6 months. I was also an [award winning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsfacts/uesugi.html) Computer Science TA at Carnegie Mellon.

Finally, I write in Japanese. The top posts on my [Japanese blog](http://naze.chibicode.com/) usually get > 20k pageviews.
